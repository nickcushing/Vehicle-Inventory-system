# PVehicle-Inventory-System
Python script for simple vehicle inventory system.
This Python script was built for my Application Development class. It will hopefully allow the user to add and delete vehicles from inventory, view the inventory, update a vehicle in inventory, and export the current inventory to a text file. I hope to also include some other values that can be labeled and stored with additional car values.
